# angular-google-maps

## Changes coming in the next few weeks

Although there weren't any changes in the master branch for awhile, development continued in the r1-dev branch. Around the end of
October 2013, we will proceed to a final release of this work.

The master branch will be renamed to *legacy* and a snapshot of *r1-dev* will become *master*. We will adopt the *git-flow*
branching model, meaning that all further development will take place in the *develop* branch. *Master* will always reflect the state
of the last release. 

If you did not do so yet, have a look at the *r1-dev* branch. It contains what angular-google-maps will become. 

Along with the release of the new codebase, we will put a new website to reflect the changes. A full API documentation and quickstart
pages will be available.

## About this project

AngularJS directives for the Google Maps Javascript API. Quite different from AngularUI's take on it. Up to you to decide what suits your needs.

Please see the example in the tree. And be sure to [RTFM](http://nlaplante.github.io/angular-google-maps "read the documentation")!

Pull requests more than welcome! Enjoy!
