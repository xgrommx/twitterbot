This implementation uses the same techniques for lazy evaluation of chained functions, for example map/select and filter/where.  This allows you as the user to write rich expressive queries against a number of data sources without taking a performance hit.  \r\n\r\nWe provide two files, a core implementation of LINQ to Objects in l2o.js and the Interactive Extensions in ix.js.  The Interactive Extensions is a set of functions that were found to be useful for the Reactive Extensions (Rx) and were ported from the push model of Rx to a pull model.\r\n\r\nGetting started is easy.  For example, we could generate data, filter it and then display the results:\r\n\r\n\t// Generate the data\r\n\tvar data = Ix.Enumerable.range(0, 10);\r\n\r\n\t// Query the data\r\n\tvar query = data\r\n\t\t.map( function (x) {\r\n\t\t\treturn x * x;\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t\t.filter( function (x) {\r\n\t\t\treturn x % 3 === 0;\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t// Now execute the query\r\n\tquery.forEach( function (x, idx) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(x, idx);\r\n\t});\r\n\r\nNote the execution of the query doesn't take place until forEach is called.\r\n\r\nThis project is a mirror of the [CodePlex](http://rx.codeplex.com/) repository.\r\n\r\n## About the Interactive Extensions Extensions ##\r\n\r\nThis set of libraries include:\r\n\r\n- **l2o.js** - Core LINQ to Objects library\r\n- **ix.js** - Interactive Extensions for JavaScript\r\n\r\n##  API Documentation ##\r\n\r\nYou can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/IxJS/tree/master/doc) as well as examples [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/IxJS/tree/master/examples).\r\n\r\n## Installation and Usage ##\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways of getting started with the Interactive Extensions including:\r\n\r\nIn a Browser:\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"l2o.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"ix.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nInstalling via NPM:\r\n\r\n    npm install ix\r\n    npm install -g ix\r\n\r\nUsing in Node.js:\r\n\r\n    var Ix = require('ix');\r\n\r\nUsing RxJS with an AMD loader such as Require.js\r\n\r\n    require({\r\n        'paths': {\r\n            'ix': 'path/to/ix.js'\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    ['ix'], function(Ix) {\r\n        var obs = Ix.Enumerable.returnValue(42);\r\n        obs.subscribe(function (x) { console.log(x); });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n## Compatibility ##\r\n\r\nIxJS has been thoroughly tested against all major browsers and supports IE6+, Chrome 4+, FireFox 1+, and Node.js v0.4+. \r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc.
