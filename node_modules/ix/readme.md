# The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript... #
*...is a set of libraries to compose pull-based collections and LINQ-style query operators in JavaScript*

The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript (IxJS) is an implementation of Language Integrated Query (LINQ) to Objects in native JavaScript with a core set of operators on par with the [.NET implementation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397926.aspx).  This implementation uses the same techniques for lazy evaluation of chained functions, for example map/select and filter/where.  This allows you as the user to write rich expressive queries against a number of data sources without taking a performance hit.  

We provide two files, a core implementation of LINQ to Objects in l2o.js and the Interactive Extensions in ix.js.  The Interactive Extensions is a set of functions that were found to be useful for the Reactive Extensions (Rx) and were ported from the push model of Rx to a pull model.

Getting started is easy.  For example, we could generate data, filter it and then display the results:

	// Generate the data
	var data = Ix.Enumerable.range(0, 10);

	// Query the data
	var query = data
		.map( function (x) {
			return x * x;
		})
		.filter( function (x) {
			return x % 3 === 0;
		});

	// Now execute the query
	query.forEach( function (x, idx) {
		console.log(x, idx);
	});

Note the execution of the query doesn't take place until forEach is called.

This project is a mirror of the [CodePlex](http://rx.codeplex.com/) repository.

## About the Interactive Extensions Extensions ##

This set of libraries include:

- **l2o.js** - Core LINQ to Objects library
- **ix.js** - Interactive Extensions for JavaScript

##  API Documentation ##

You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/IxJS/tree/master/doc) as well as examples [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/IxJS/tree/master/examples).

## Installation and Usage ##

There are multiple ways of getting started with the Interactive Extensions including:

In a Browser:

    <script src="l2o.js"></script>
    <script src="ix.js"></script>

Installing via NPM:

    npm install ix
    npm install -g ix

Using in Node.js:

    var Ix = require('ix');

Using RxJS with an AMD loader such as Require.js

    require({
        'paths': {
            'ix': 'path/to/ix.js'
        }
    },
    ['ix'], function(Ix) {
        var obs = Ix.Enumerable.returnValue(42);
        obs.subscribe(function (x) { console.log(x); });
    });

## Compatibility ##

IxJS has been thoroughly tested against all major browsers and supports IE6+, Chrome 4+, FireFox 1+, and Node.js v0.4+.
